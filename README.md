# cocktail-tunez

Booze 'n Tunes is an app that recreates the bar experience. Users click from the dropdown menu and select a mood. They are then displayed with a cocktail drink recipe, associated playlist, an associated gif, and a fun little message. The User is then also able to change the playlist or drink within that mood. They can also change the mood itself.
