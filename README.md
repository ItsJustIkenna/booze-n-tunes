# Booze 'n Tunes

## Description

[Booze 'n Tunes](https://spencerv86.github.io/booze-n-tunes/) is an app that recreates the bar experience. Users click from the dropdown menu and select a mood. They are then displayed with a cocktail drink recipe, associated playlist, an associated gif, and a fun little message. The User is then also able to change the playlist or drink within that mood. They can also change the mood itself.

## Usage
To use our application, simply click the dropdown menu on the homepage and choose from one of the listed moods. You'll have the option of 'Happy', 'Sad', 'Classy', 'Excited', or 'Chill'.

Once a mood is chosen, the site will redirect you to our results page. On this page you will find a playlist and cocktail recipe randomly generated from our curated arrays for each mood.
